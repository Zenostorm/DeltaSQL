<h2>Weapons</h2>
<h4>
    Weapons used to inflict damage on NPCs and other Wastelanders.
    Every gun loads a specfic caliber, fed through compatible magazines, though some guns feature internal magazines.
    All the weapons serve a unique purpose. Some are cheap and accessible, while others are built for combat.
    Some effective in close quarters combat, some specialized in shooting at range,
    while the most reliable weapons are versatile and proficient at all ranges.
