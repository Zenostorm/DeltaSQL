<h2>Ammunition</h2>
<h4>
    Ammunition is what loads into magazines or directly into the internal mag of a weapon.
    Most weapons use cartridges except shotguns which accept shells,
    and the RPG-7 which is loaded with a PG-7V anti-tank round.
    Ammunition comes in many variants that have their strengths and drawbacks,
    the most common variants being FMJ tracer and armor piercing rounds.
