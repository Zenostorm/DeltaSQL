<h2>Lootable Containers</h2>
<h4>
    Since the nuclear incident, everything in the wasteland is fair game.
    Lootable containers are the main source of equipment and supplies.
    While most containers can be found throughout the wasteland, 
    the most valuable are locked behind saferooms and bunkers.
